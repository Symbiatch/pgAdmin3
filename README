==================
 
Introduction
------------

pgAdmin III is the most popular and feature rich Open Source administration and
development platform for PostgreSQL, the most advanced Open Source database in
the world. The application may be used on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X and 
Windows platforms to manage PostgreSQL 8.2 and above running on any platform,
as well as commercial versions of PostgreSQL such as Mammoth PostgreSQL, 
EnterpriseDB Postgres Plus Advanced Server and Greenplum Database.

pgAdmin III is designed to answer the needs of all users, from writing simple 
SQL queries to developing complex databases. The graphical interface supports 
all PostgreSQL features and makes administration easy. The application also 
includes a syntax highlighting SQL editor, a server-side code editor, an 
SQL/batch/shell job scheduling agent, support for the Slony-I replication 
engine and much more. Server connection may be made using TCP/IP or Unix Domain
Sockets (on *nix platforms), and may be SSL encrypted for security. No 
additional drivers are required to communicate with the database server.

pgAdmin III is developed by a community of PostgreSQL experts around the world 
and is available in more than a dozen languages. It is Free Software released
